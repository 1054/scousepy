scousepy
========

The ``scousepy`` package provides a method by which large amounts of complex
astronomical spectral line data in a systematic way. The current version fits
multiple Gaussian profiles to spectral line emission. A description of the code
can be found in `Henshaw et al. 2016 <http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abs/2016arXiv160103732H>`_.
